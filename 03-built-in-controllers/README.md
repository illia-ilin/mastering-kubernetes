# Module 03 â€” Built-In Controllers

This module provides a deep understanding of **native Kubernetes controllers** â€” their reconciliation behavior, roles in maintaining desired state, and best practices for production usage.  
Itâ€™s part of my hands-on work from the [Fwdays *Kubernetes Mastering Course*](https://fwdays.com/en/event/kubernetes-mastering-course).

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- Develop a solid grasp of how built-in controllers reconcile cluster state.

- Explore how different controllers manage workloads, rollouts, and system daemons.

- Gain experience building workload scenarios using multiple controller types.

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered

### ReplicaSet vs Deployment

- Replica count control, rollout strategies, and revision history management.

### DaemonSet

- Node-level workloads for logging, monitoring, and storage sidecars.

### StatefulSet

- Stable pod identities, headless services, and ordered scaling behavior.

### Job & CronJob

- Batch and scheduled jobs, `backoffLimit`, and `concurrencyPolicy`.

## ðŸ§ª Lab Exercises

### Level 1 â€” Foundation
- Check Den's command history in the repository and practice various controller operations.

### Level 2 â€” Advanced
- Register a **node** with your control plane using a valid **kubeconfig**.

### Level 3 â€” Maximum
- Register a **node** with the control plane using a **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)** workflow.
